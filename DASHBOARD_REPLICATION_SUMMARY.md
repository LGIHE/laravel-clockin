## Testing Recommendations

1. **Admin Dashboard**:
   - Verify all stat cards display correct data
   - Check monthly attendance table shows top users
   - Test notices and holidays sections load properly
   - Verify upcoming holidays calculation is correct

2. **User Dashboard**:
   - Test clock in/out functionality
   - Verify work duration updates in real-time (may need JavaScript)
   - Check chart data displays correctly
   - Test leave count calculation
   - Verify notices and holidays display

3. **Data Dependencies**:
   - Ensure Holiday model and table exist
   - Ensure Notice model and table exist with `is_active` field
   - Verify attendance `worked` field stores seconds
   - Check leave status relationships work correctly

## Notes

- The dashboards now visually match the clockin-node application
- All backend calculations are in place for statistics
- Chart visualization uses simple CSS bars (can be enhanced with JavaScript charting library)
- Work duration for clocked-in users may need real-time updates via Livewire polling or JavaScript
- The design is fully responsive with Tailwind CSS classes
