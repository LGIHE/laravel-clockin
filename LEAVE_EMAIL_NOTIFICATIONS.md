# Leave Email Notifications Implementation

## Problem
When a user applied for leave, the system only created the leave record and sent in-app notifications. No email notifications were being sent to supervisors or applicants.

## Solution
Added comprehensive email notification system for leave management.

## What Was Added

### 1. Mail Classes (app/Mail/)
- **LeaveRequestMail.php** - Sent to supervisors when a new leave request is submitted
- **LeaveApprovedMail.php** - Sent to applicant when their leave is approved
- **LeaveRejectedMail.php** - Sent to applicant when their leave is rejected

### 2. Email Templates (resources/views/emails/)
- **leave-request.blade.php** - Professional email template for supervisors
- **leave-approved.blade.php** - Congratulatory email for approved leaves
- **leave-rejected.blade.php** - Informative email for rejected leaves

### 3. Updated LeaveService.php
Enhanced the service to send both in-app and email notifications:

#### When Leave is Applied:
- ✅ Creates leave record in database
- ✅ Sends in-app notification to supervisors
- ✅ **NEW:** Sends email to all supervisors

#### When Leave is Approved:
- ✅ Updates leave status
- ✅ Sends in-app notification to applicant
- ✅ **NEW:** Sends email to applicant

#### When Leave is Rejected:
- ✅ Updates leave status
- ✅ Sends in-app notification to applicant
- ✅ **NEW:** Sends email to applicant

## Email Features

### Leave Request Email (to Supervisors)
- Employee name and email
- Leave date and type
- Reason for leave
- Direct link to review the request

### Leave Approved Email (to Applicant)
- Leave date and type
- Approver name
- Direct link to view details
- Encouraging message

### Leave Rejected Email (to Applicant)
- Leave date and type

## Email Design
All emails follow the existing ClockIn email template design with:
- Responsive layout
- Professional gradient headers
- Color-coded status (blue for pending, green for approved, red for rejected)
- Clear call-to-action buttons
- Consistent branding

## Testing
To test the email notifications:

1. Ensure your SMTP settings are configured in `.env`:
```env
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=your-smtp-host
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=your-email
MAIL_PASSWORD=your-password
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=noreply@yourdomain.com
MAIL_FROM_NAME="ClockIn System"
```

2. Apply for a leave as a regular user
3. Check supervisor's email inbox
4. Approve/reject the leave as a supervisor
5. Check applicant's email inbox

## Error Handling
- Email failures are logged but don't prevent leave operations
- In-app notifications still work if email fails
- Graceful fallback ensures system reliability

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
- Add email queuing for better performance
- Add email preferences (allow users to opt-out)
- Add CC to HR department
- Add calendar attachments (.ics files)
- Add leave summary reports via email
