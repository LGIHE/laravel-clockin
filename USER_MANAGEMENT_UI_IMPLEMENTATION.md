## Routes

### Web Routes
```php
// User Management (Admin only)
Route::middleware('role:admin')->group(function () {
    Route::get('/users', UserList::class)->name('users.index');
    Route::get('/users/create', UserForm::class)->name('users.create');
    Route::get('/users/{userId}/edit', UserForm::class)->name('users.edit');
});
```

## Middleware

The routes are protected by:
1. `auth` middleware - Ensures user is authenticated
2. `role:admin` middleware - Restricts access to admin users only

## Integration with Existing Services

The components use the existing `UserService` for all business logic:
- `createUser($data)` - Create new user
- `updateUser($userId, $data)` - Update user
- `assignSupervisor($userId, $supervisorId)` - Assign supervisor
- `assignProjects($userId, $projectIds)` - Assign projects
- `changeStatus($userId, $status)` - Change user status
- `deleteUser($userId)` - Soft delete user
- `getUserById($userId)` - Get user details
- `getUsers($filters)` - Get filtered user list

## UI Components Used

The views utilize existing UI components:
- `<x-ui.button>` - Styled buttons with variants (primary, outline, danger)
- Toast notifications via Alpine.js events
- Modal dialogs with Alpine.js

## Styling

All components follow the existing design system:
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Consistent color scheme (blue for primary, red for danger, green for success)
- Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Hover states and transitions
- Focus states for accessibility
