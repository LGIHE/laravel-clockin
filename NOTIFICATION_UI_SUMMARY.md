## Technical Implementation

### Component Architecture
```
NotificationDropdown (Livewire)
├── Fetches notifications from database
├── Manages dropdown state
├── Handles mark as read actions
└── Dispatches toast events

notification-dropdown.blade.php (View)
├── Bell icon with badge
├── Dropdown panel with transitions
├── Notification list
└── Empty state
```

### Database Integration
- Uses existing `notifications` table
- Queries unread notifications for authenticated user
- Updates `read_at` timestamp when marking as read
- Supports notification types and data structure

### User Experience
- Smooth dropdown transitions using Alpine.js
- Click-away to close functionality
- Hover states for interactive elements
- Loading states during actions
- Toast feedback for all actions

✅ **Requirement 10.3:** Mark notification as read functionality  
✅ **Requirement 14.1:** Notification icon in header  
✅ **Requirement 14.2:** Role-based notification access  

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Manual Testing:**
   - Create test notifications in database
   - Verify bell icon shows correct unread count

3. **Database Testing:**
   ```sql
   -- Create test notification
   INSERT INTO notifications (id, type, notifiable_type, notifiable_id, data, read_at, created_at, updated_at)
   VALUES (
       UUID(),
       'App\\Notifications\\LeaveApproved',
       'App\\Models\\User',
       'YOUR_USER_ID',
       '{"title":"Leave Approved","message":"Your leave request has been approved."}',

       NOW()
   );
   ```
