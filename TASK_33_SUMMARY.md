## Technical Implementation Details

### Role-Based Access Control
```php
// Navigation items filtered by user role
$userRole = $user->role ?? 'USER';
$filteredItems = array_filter($navigationItems, function($item) use ($userRole) {
    return in_array($userRole, $item['roles'] ?? []);
});
```

### Active Menu Highlighting
```php
$isActive = $currentRoute === $item['route'] || 
            (isset($item['activeRoutes']) && in_array($currentRoute, $item['activeRoutes']));
```

**Active Styles:**
- Background: `bg-blue-50`
- Text: `text-blue-700`
- Icon: `text-blue-700`

### Responsive Behavior
- **Desktop (≥1024px):** Sidebar always visible, full labels shown
- **Mobile (<1024px):** Sidebar hidden by default, hamburger menu, overlay

### State Management
```javascript
x-data="{ 
    sidebarOpen: false,      // Mobile sidebar visibility
    sidebarCollapsed: false  // Desktop sidebar collapse
}"
```

## Styling and Design

### Color Scheme
- **Primary:** Blue-600 (#2563eb)
- **Success:** Green-600
- **Warning:** Yellow-600
- **Danger:** Red-600
- **Neutral:** Gray-50 to Gray-900

### Typography
- **Font Family:** Inter (from Google Fonts)
- **Sizes:** text-sm, text-base, text-lg, text-xl, text-2xl

### Icons
- All icons are inline SVG from Heroicons
- Consistent 5x5 or 6x6 sizing
- Proper stroke-width and styling

## Accessibility Features

### ARIA Labels
- ✅ Screen reader text for icons
- ✅ Proper semantic HTML structure
- ✅ Keyboard navigation support

### Focus States
- ✅ Visible focus rings on interactive elements
- ✅ `focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500`

### Semantic HTML
- ✅ `<nav>` for navigation
- ✅ `<header>` for header
- ✅ `<aside>` for sidebar
- ✅ `<main>` for content

## Performance Optimizations

- ✅ Lazy loading of sidebar content (only when authenticated)
- ✅ Minimal JavaScript (Alpine.js only)
- ✅ Inline SVG icons (no external requests)
- ✅ Tailwind CSS purges unused styles in production
- ✅ Wire:navigate for SPA-like navigation (no full page reloads)
