# Dashboard Error Fix

## Error Details
**Error**: Trying to access array offset on null  
**Location**: `resources/views/livewire/dashboard/user-dashboard.blade.php:68`

## Root Cause
The `$attendanceStatus` variable was not being safely initialized, causing null reference errors when:
1. The dashboard data failed to load
2. The user doesn't exist
3. There was an error in the DashboardService

## Fixes Applied

### 1. UserDashboard Livewire Component (`app/Livewire/Dashboard/UserDashboard.php`)

#### Added Safe Initialization in `mount()`:
```php
public function mount()
{
    // Initialize with safe defaults
    $this->dashboardData = [
        'attendance_status' => [
            'clocked_in' => false,
            'in_time' => null,
            'in_message' => null,
        ],
        'stats' => [
            'leave_this_year' => 0,
            'last_30_days_formatted' => '00:00:00',
        ],
        'work_duration' => '00:00:00',
        'recent_attendance' => collect([]),
    ];
    $this->attendanceStatus = $this->dashboardData['attendance_status'];
    $this->chartData = [];
    $this->holidays = collect([]);
    $this->notices = collect([]);
    
    $this->loadDashboardData();
}
```

#### Enhanced `loadDashboardData()` with Fallbacks:
- Added null coalescing operators for all data assignments
- Added comprehensive fallback data structure on exception
- Ensures `$attendanceStatus` always has a valid array structure

### 2. User Dashboard View (`resources/views/livewire/dashboard/user-dashboard.blade.php`)

#### Safe Null Checks Added:
- Line 68: `@if(isset($attendanceStatus) && is_array($attendanceStatus) && ($attendanceStatus['clocked_in'] ?? false) && ($attendanceStatus['in_time'] ?? null))`
- Line 103: `@if(!isset($attendanceStatus) || !is_array($attendanceStatus) || !($attendanceStatus['clocked_in'] ?? false))`
- Line 127: `@if($attendanceStatus['in_time'] ?? null)`
- Lines 148-156: Added PHP variable to safely determine clock status

### 3. DashboardService (`app/Services/DashboardService.php`)

#### Enhanced Leave Calculation:
- Wrapped leave status query in try-catch
- Falls back to simple count if status relationship fails
- Prevents errors when LeaveStatus relationship has issues

## Testing
After applying these fixes, the dashboard should:
1. Load without errors even if data is missing
2. Show default values when data can't be loaded
3. Handle authentication issues gracefully
4. Display proper error toast messages

## Next Steps
1. Verify you're logged in as a valid user
2. Check if user exists in the database
3. Ensure Leave model relationships are properly configured
4. Test clock in/out functionality
