# üéØ FINAL EMAIL DEBUGGING GUIDE

## Current Status

‚úÖ **Email sending works!** (proven by `php artisan email:test` and `php artisan user:test-create`)  
‚úÖ **SMTP configuration is correct**  
‚úÖ **UserService code is working**  
‚ùå **Emails not sent when creating users via Web UI**

## The Problem

When you create a user through the admin panel, the email is not being sent. But the test commands work perfectly.

## Step-by-Step Debugging

### Step 1: Clear the Log File

```bash
# Clear the log to start fresh
> storage/logs/laravel.log
```

### Step 2: Start Monitoring Logs

**Open a NEW terminal window** and run:

```bash
cd /Users/caleb/LGIHE/Dev/NEW/attendance/laravel-clockin
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log
```

Leave this window open - you'll see logs appear in real-time.

### Step 3: Create a User via Web UI

1. Open your browser
2. Go to the ClockIn admin panel
3. Navigate to Users ‚Üí Add New User
4. Fill in the form:
   - Name: Test User
   - Email: test@example.com (or any email)
   - Password: Test123!
   - Select a user level
   - Click "Save" or "Create User"

### Step 4: Watch the Logs

In the terminal where `tail -f` is running, you should see:

#### **Scenario A: Logs appear**
```
[timestamp] local.INFO: UserForm: Creating new user via UI
[timestamp] local.INFO: User created in database, preparing to send email
[timestamp] local.INFO: Attempting to send account setup email to new user
[timestamp] local.INFO: Account setup email sent successfully
```

‚úÖ **If you see this**: Emails ARE being sent! Check your Mailtrap inbox.

#### **Scenario B: No logs at all**
```
(nothing appears)
```

‚ùå **If you see this**: The UserForm save() method is NOT being called.

**Possible causes:**
- Validation is failing (check for validation errors in the UI)
- JavaScript error preventing form submission
- Form is submitting to wrong route

#### **Scenario C: Partial logs**
```
[timestamp] local.INFO: UserForm: Creating new user via UI
[timestamp] local.INFO: User created in database, preparing to send email
[timestamp] local.ERROR: Failed to send account setup email
```

‚ùå **If you see this**: Email sending is failing. Check the error message in logs.

### Step 5: Check for Validation Errors

If NO logs appear, check the browser console:

1. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to "Console" tab
3. Try creating a user again
4. Look for any JavaScript errors

Also check the UI for validation error messages (they should appear in red near the form fields).

### Step 6: Verify Server is Running

```bash
ps aux | grep "artisan serve" | grep -v grep
```

Should show the server running. If not, start it:

```bash
php artisan serve --host=0.0.0.0
```

## Testing Checklist

Run these commands to verify everything:

```bash
# 1. Test email configuration
php artisan email:test test@example.com

# 2. Test user creation via command
php artisan user:test-create test-$(date +%s)@example.com

# 3. Check if server is running
ps aux | grep "artisan serve" | grep -v grep

# 4. Run diagnostic
./diagnose-email.sh

# 5. Monitor logs in real-time
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log
```

## Expected Behavior

When creating a user (via UI OR command), you should see these logs:

```
1. UserForm: Creating new user via UI (only from web UI)
2. User created in database, preparing to send email
3. Attempting to send account setup email to new user
   - Includes: user_id, email, name, setup_url, mail_mailer, from_address
4. Account setup email sent successfully
   - Includes: user_id, email
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue #1: No logs when creating user via UI

**Cause**: Form validation failing or JavaScript error

**Solution**:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Look for red validation messages in the UI
3. Ensure all required fields are filled
4. Try with a simple email like `test@example.com`

### Issue #2: Logs show email attempt but error

**Cause**: SMTP connection or authentication issue

**Solution**:
1. Check error message in logs
2. Verify SMTP credentials in `.env`
3. Restart server: `php artisan serve --host=0.0.0.0`

### Issue #3: Emails sent but not received

**Cause**: Using `live.smtp.mailtrap.io` (production) instead of sandbox

**Solution**:
For testing, use sandbox:
```env
MAIL_HOST=sandbox.smtp.mailtrap.io
MAIL_PORT=2525
```

For production (real emails):
```env
MAIL_HOST=live.smtp.mailtrap.io
MAIL_PORT=587
```

## Live Debugging Session

### Terminal 1: Monitor Logs
```bash
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log
```

### Terminal 2: Server (if not already running)
```bash
php artisan serve --host=0.0.0.0
```

### Terminal 3: Run diagnostic when needed
```bash
./diagnose-email.sh
```

### Browser: Create User
1. Fill form
2. Submit
3. Watch Terminal 1 for logs

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ Logs show all 4 steps (create attempt ‚Üí user created ‚Üí email attempt ‚Üí email sent)  
‚úÖ Email appears in Mailtrap inbox within seconds  
‚úÖ Setup link in email works and redirects to password setup page  
‚úÖ After setting password, user can login successfully  

## If Nothing Works

Try creating a user with this exact data:

- **Name**: Test User
- **Email**: test123@example.com
- **Password**: Test123!@
- **User Level**: User (or Admin)
- **Status**: Active

Then check:
1. Logs: `tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log`
2. Database: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'test123@example.com'`
3. Command test: `php artisan user:test-create another@example.com`

If the command works but UI doesn't, the issue is in the Livewire form, not the email system.

## Contact Points

Files to check if issues persist:

1. **UserForm**: `app/Livewire/Users/UserForm.php` (line 175+)
2. **UserService**: `app/Services/UserService.php` (line 22+)
3. **Email Config**: `config/mail.php`
4. **Environment**: `.env` (MAIL_* variables)
5. **Logs**: `storage/logs/laravel.log`

## Next Steps

After following this guide, you should know:

1. ‚úÖ Whether UserForm is being called when you submit the form
2. ‚úÖ Whether UserService createUser is being executed
3. ‚úÖ Whether email sending is being attempted
4. ‚úÖ Whether the email send succeeds or fails
5. ‚úÖ What the specific error is (if any)

Then we can fix the specific issue!
