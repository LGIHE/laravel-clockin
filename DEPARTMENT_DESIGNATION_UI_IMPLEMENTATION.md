- Full CRUD operations for departments
- Search functionality (name and description)
- Sortable columns
- User count display
- Inline editing through modals
- Validation for unique names
- Prevention of deletion when department has active users

**Blade View:** `resources/views/livewire/departments/department-list.blade.php`
- Responsive table layout
- Search bar with real-time filtering
- Create/Edit/Delete modals
- User count badges
- Action buttons with icons

- Action buttons with icons

### Routes Added
```php
// Admin-only routes
Route::get('/departments', DepartmentList::class)->name('departments.index');
Route::get('/designations', DesignationList::class)->name('designations.index');
```

## Features

### Department Management Features
1. **List View**
   - Paginated table (15 items per page)
   - Columns: Name, Description, User Count, Created Date, Actions

## Technical Implementation

### Livewire Component Structure
Both components follow the same pattern:

```php
class DepartmentList extends Component
{
    use WithPagination;
    
    // Properties
    public $search = '';
    public $sortBy = 'created_at';
    public $sortOrder = 'desc';
    public $perPage = 15;
    
    // Modal states
    public $showCreateModal = false;
    public $showEditModal = false;
    public $showDeleteModal = false;
    
    // Form fields
    public $departmentId = null;
    public $name = '';
    public $description = '';
    
    // Methods
    - mount()
    - updatingSearch()
    - sortByColumn()
    - openCreateModal()
    - createDepartment()
    - openEditModal()
    - updateDepartment()
    - confirmDelete()
    - deleteDepartment()
    - render()
}
```

### Validation Rules
**Department:**
```php
'name' => 'required|string|max:255',
'description' => 'nullable|string|max:500',
```

**Designation:**
```php
'name' => 'required|string|max:255',
```

### Database Queries
- Uses `withCount('users')` to display user counts
- Implements search with `LIKE` queries
- Supports dynamic sorting
- Pagination with 15 items per page

### Authorization
- All routes protected by `auth` middleware
- Additional `role:admin` middleware for admin-only access
- Component-level authorization checks

## UI/UX Design

### Design Principles
1. **Consistency:** Matches existing User Management UI patterns
2. **Clarity:** Clear labels, icons, and feedback messages
3. **Efficiency:** Inline editing reduces page loads
4. **Safety:** Confirmation modals for destructive actions
5. **Feedback:** Toast notifications for all operations

### Visual Elements
- **Icons:** 
  - Department: Building icon (blue)
  - Designation: Briefcase icon (purple)
  - Edit: Pencil icon (indigo)
  - Delete: Trash icon (red)
  
- **Color Scheme:**
  - Primary actions: Blue (#3B82F6)
  - Success: Green (#10B981)
  - Danger: Red (#EF4444)
  - Info: Purple (#8B5CF6)

- **Badges:**
  - User count: Colored badges matching entity type
  - Status indicators: Color-coded for quick recognition

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-friendly table layout
- Responsive modals
- Touch-friendly action buttons
- Adaptive spacing and sizing

## Integration with Existing System

### API Integration
The UI components interact with existing API controllers:
- `DepartmentController` - Handles department CRUD operations
- `DesignationController` - Handles designation CRUD operations

### Model Relationships
```php
// Department Model
public function users() {
    return $this->hasMany(User::class, 'department_id');
}

// Designation Model
public function users() {
    return $this->hasMany(User::class, 'designation_id');
}
```

### Navigation Integration
Links added to admin dashboard for easy access:
- Departments link in admin menu
- Designations link in admin menu

## Security Considerations

1. **Authorization:**
   - Admin-only access enforced at route and component level
   - Unauthorized users redirected with error message

2. **Validation:**
   - Server-side validation for all inputs
   - Unique name constraints enforced
   - XSS protection through Blade escaping

3. **CSRF Protection:**
   - Laravel's built-in CSRF protection active
   - Tokens included in all forms

4. **Soft Deletes:**
   - Records marked as deleted, not removed
   - Allows data recovery if needed

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Debounced Search:** 300ms delay prevents excessive queries
2. **Eager Loading:** `withCount('users')` reduces N+1 queries
3. **Pagination:** Limits records per page to 15
4. **Livewire Wire:model.live:** Real-time updates without full page reload

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. Test all CRUD operations
2. Verify validation rules
3. Test search and sorting
4. Verify user count accuracy
5. Test deletion prevention
6. Check authorization

### Automated Testing
Consider adding:
- Feature tests for CRUD operations
- Validation tests
- Authorization tests
- UI component tests

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Bulk operations (delete multiple)
2. Export functionality (CSV/Excel)
3. Advanced filtering options
4. Department hierarchy support
5. Designation levels/grades
6. Audit log for changes
7. Import from CSV

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** Modals not opening
- **Solution:** Ensure Alpine.js is loaded and x-data directive is present

**Issue:** Search not working
- **Solution:** Check wire:model.live.debounce is correctly set

**Issue:** User count incorrect
- **Solution:** Verify withCount('users') is in query

**Issue:** Validation errors not showing
- **Solution:** Check @error directives in Blade templates

## Conclusion

The Department and Designation Management UI provides a complete, user-friendly interface for managing organizational structure. The implementation follows Laravel and Livewire best practices, maintains consistency with existing UI patterns, and includes proper validation, authorization, and user feedback mechanisms.
